## Mini CTF on Cryptography and Steganography

### Introduction

In this mini CTF, we will be covering the basics of cryptography and steganography. Cryptography involves encoding and decoding messages to protect them from unauthorized access. Steganography, on the other hand, involves hiding messages in plain sight, such as within images, audio files, or other types of media. 

### Cryptography

We will cover two types of cryptography techniques in this CTF: encoding/chipering and hashing.

### Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of sound. In steganography, it can be used to hide messages in audio files. We will cover the basics of spectrograms in this CTF.
